                        as the C++ code base.
                        NEW VERSION: 0.4.8

                        example, "origin" instead of "mOrigin").  The modified
                        classes are gmtl.AABox*, gmtl.Coord*, gmtl.Plane*,

2002-06-12 subatomic    EulerAngle is templatized on RotationOrder now.
                        This means that EulerXYZ and EulerZYX are discrete types
                        which will allow the benefit of type safety and compile 
                        time optimization.
2002-06-10 subatomic    Generators all use Euler and Axis now.
                        Changed to set() and make() naming on functions
                        that were actually set (like setRot(quat,axisangle)

                        set(anytype, anyothertype) and make<anytype>(anyother).
                        Coord is now templatized on POS_TYPE, ROT_TYPE.

                        built-in primitive types.

                        Added support to Math.h to compile out the float trig

                        etc...) to work around compilers that dont support
                        these trig functions.
2002-05-17 subatomic    Doxygen: grouped everything into "modules", logical 
                        groupings that make the reference guide much easier
